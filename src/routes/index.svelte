Welcome to my Road trip! I came up with the idea for this site while looking at different development roadmaps. I hadn't looked at one in quite a while and wanted to see if I had made any progress in regards to the map. I have! Then I wanted to look at other ones and that made me think I should share my roadmap. It is not done yet as I am still learning development. So this is my road trip, which I am still on. Hope this can inspire you or give you insight. 

Importantly, don't give up!
